# Exploiting VNC Service on Metasploitable 2 (Port 5900)


Virtual Network Computing(VNC) is a popular remote connection tool that can gain access to the desktop of a computer and control it. It gives the user a graphical user interface (GUI) to assist in controlling and managing an endpoint.
Metasploitable 2 is an intentionally vulnerable Linux machine used for penetration testing practice. One of its services, VNC (Virtual Network Computing), is exposed on port 5900. VNC allows remote desktop access, but if misconfigured (like using weak authentication), attackers can gain control of the system.

## Lab Requirements
- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Metasploitable 2 (Target)
- Both machines on the same network (e.g., VirtualBox/VMware Host-only or NAT network).


## Step 1: Reconnaissance
  Using NMAP scan the target machine 

nmap -sV  <target_ip>

The scan shows we have some open ports and services that are running on the target machine including their version numbers.
Now that I have identified the vnc port 5900 is open 


## Step 2: Search for Vulnerabilities in Metasploit

I’ll now launch Metasploit in my terminal to exploit it,

for me to do this I’ll type “msfconsole” and hit enter to launch Metasploit.

Now Metasploit is fully up and ready.


## Step 3: Use the VNC login Bypass Module

VNC port helps us connect to a remote VNC Server.

What is VNC Server: It is a graphical desktop sharing system that allows us to remotely control a computer from a local computer while displaying the VNC server screen content on our local computer.


Now I’m going to search for the vnc exploit, this time I’ll be doing a precise search.

"grep scanner search vnc"

I’ll select the exploit I want to make use of from the above list, in this case I am going to make use of the vnc_login which is no. 108,
in order to select the exploit we want to run I’ll be making use of the “use 108” command.


## Step 4: Exploit and Gain Access

Next I’ll be setting up the parameters for the exploit to run, to see the parameters of the exploit I’ll run this command “show options” this will list out all parameters needed for the exploit to run.

I’ll be making use of the “set” command to change any of the parameters i want. In this case I’m only going to change the RHOSTS to our target machine’s I.P address which is 192.168.0.3


   <img width="590" height="39" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-26 10-29-13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94f59a20-257b-48f2-b2e2-01c4bec91779" />

Parameters has been set, now I’ll run the exploit by using the “run” command



   <img width="652" height="125" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-26 10-29-40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ea2dd33-bc22-43b4-b681-49dd8d9c9238" />

   

As seen above the exploit ran successfully and it provided me with the VNC Server’s password which is “password”.


Now I’ll try to connect to the VNC server, in order to do this I’ll open up a new terminal and type “vncviewer < target ip>” this will enable me get access to the target machine.



  <img width="568" height="123" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-26 10-36-50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ab847c2-09db-4162-89ed-6ecbda1e4a8e" />

as shown earlier when we ran the login exploit it showed us that the password was password


The graphical user interface of the vnc connection will pop up as shown below:

  <img width="638" height="560" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-26 10-37-46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4611e6f6-4fc4-4726-a161-6688a94fe6eb" />


Looking at the terminal, we can see that the user logged on was root.

## Step 5: Post-Exploitation

we have access to the system. As a root user, we can do whatever we want to the system. Metasploitable 2 was exploited using a poor password.

You can further move on with the pentesting step such as post-exploitation.

Few things you can do:


- Establish a back door to gain persistence.
- Move laterally if needed.
- Cover up your tracks

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have seen how to exploit the VNC service of the vulnerable Metasploitable 2 machine.

Hope the technique here has helped you in your learning as it did help me too!
