Exploiting VNC Service on Metasploitable 2 (Port 5900)


Virtual Network Computing(VNC) is a popular remote connection tool that can gain access to the desktop of a computer and control it. It gives the user a graphical user interface (GUI) to assist in controlling and managing an endpoint.
Metasploitable 2 is an intentionally vulnerable Linux machine used for penetration testing practice. One of its services, VNC (Virtual Network Computing), is exposed on port 5900. VNC allows remote desktop access, but if misconfigured (like using weak authentication), attackers can gain control of the system.

Lab Requirements
Kali Linux (Attacker)
Metasploitable 2 (Target)
Both machines on the same network (e.g., VirtualBox/VMware Host-only or NAT network).

Reconnaissance
Using NMAP scan the target machine 
nmap -sV -p 5900 <target_ip>
