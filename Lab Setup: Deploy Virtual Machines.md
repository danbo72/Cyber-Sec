# Project Title:  Lab Setup: Deploy Virtual Machines
## Project Supervisor: Norbert Ephraim
 *Prepared By: Daniel Akpan  21/07/2025*

## 1. Project Overview
Virtual machines (VMs) are essential tools used to create isolated and virtualized environments that allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical computer. These environments are valuable for various purposes, such as software testing, malware analysis, and cybersecurity training.
By completing this exercise, you will develop essential skills in creating and managing virtual machines for various purposes. This exercise prepares you to work in various IT roles, including cybersecurity, where virtual machines are commonly used for malware analysis, penetration testing, and secure software testing.

## 2. Project Goals
- The goal is to install a Hypervisor on your computer (host).
- Set up two virtual machines (Kali Linux and Windows 10) on it.
- Configure the virtual machines to be on an isolated network.

## 3. Lab Design & Considerations

### 3.1. Hypervisor Selection
Chosen Hypervisor: VirtualBox
Reason: it’s simple to use

### 3.2. Operating System Images

## 4. Lab Implementation Steps

### Prerequisites:
- Computer with at least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- At least 80GB of free disk space
- Hardware-based support for virtualization

### 4.1. Install Hypervisor
- Downloaded and installed VirtualBox on Windows 11 host machine.

The virtualization technology used to run the VMs is Oracle VirtualBox, as it allows you to run multiple operating systems on your computer. It can be downloaded from the official website, https://www.virtualbox.org/.

Once on the website, click on the download button to get started. You will be redirected to a page where you must select the one compatible with your operating system. For this purpose, I will download the one for Windows and also click the second arrow button, which is “Accept and Download,” to download the VirtualBox Extension file.

You should now have the file in your folder, just like the screenshot below.

### 4.4. Network Configuration

•	Created a custom NAT Network in VirtualBox
•	Ensured both VMs were attached to the same NAT Network
•	Disabled host access and external internet access to enforce isolation

### 5.2. Connectivity Test
### Ping Test: From Windows VM to Linux VM
 
 Command: ping <Linux-VM-IP>

<img width="494" height="128" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-19 080140" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62fa7b10-27cc-49ff-a284-53968f6723ab" />

Successful response with <1ms latency

## 6. Postmortem & Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:

- VirtualBox’s NAT Network worked effectively for isolation.
- OS installation was smooth.
- Internal ping test confirmed correct VM communication setup.

### Challenges:
- Initial misconfiguration by selecting "NAT" instead of "NAT Network".
- Needed to configure the NAT Network settings to enable DHCP manually.

### Key Takeaways:
- Networking mode selection is critical to VM isolation.
- Hands-on VM setup builds foundational skills for penetration testing labs and malware analysis environments.
- Understanding hypervisor networking is essential for real-world cybersecurity lab design.
